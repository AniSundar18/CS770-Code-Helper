        "suggestion": "\nThe code you've provided has a fundamental issue: the `sort()` method does not work directly on strings in Python and does not return a sorted version of the string. Instead, sort() is a method for lists, not strings, and it sorts the list in place, returning None. To check if two strings are anagrams, you need to compare sorted versions of the strings. You can use the sorted() function, which works on strings and returns a sorted list of characters. Then, you can compare these sorted lists.\n"
