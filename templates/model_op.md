Starting Values: The typical starting values for a Fibonacci sequence are `0` and `1`, not `0` and `2`. So, the initial values of `a` and `b` should be set to `0` and `1` respectively.

Extra `print()` call: The extra `print()` call inside the loop will result in each number being printed on a new line, which may not be the intended output. If you want all numbers in the sequence to be printed on the same line, you should remove the print() statement inside the loop.

Function Return Value: The `fib()` function does not return a value, so when it is printed, None is displayed. If you only want to display the Fibonacci sequence, you should call `fib(5)` without the `print()` function wrapping it.
